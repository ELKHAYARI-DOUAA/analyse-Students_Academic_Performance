# 1. Introduction  
This project analyzes a student performance dataset.  
Goals of this analysis:

- Explore descriptive statistics  
- Visualize key academic performance indicators  
- Understand relationships between variables  
- Build a machine learning model to predict student scores  

All dataset exploration, plots, and ML outputs come from Python execution.

| Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| gender | Student gender |
| race_ethnicity | Ethnic group |
| parental_education | Parent's education level |
| lunch | Lunch type |
| test_preparation | Whether test prep was completed |
| math_score | Math exam score |
| reading_score | Reading exam score |
| writing_score | Writing exam score |
| study_hours | Weekly study hours |
| avg_score | Average of math, reading, and writing |

# 3. Descriptive Statistics  

Key observations:

- Average scores mostly range between **60 and 90**.
- Study hours vary widely.
- Reading and writing scores are strongly correlated.
- Overall performance is relatively high.

---

# 4. Visualizations & Interpretation  

All graphs are saved in the `/mnt/data/` directory.

---

## 📍 4.1. Histogram — Distribution of Average Scores  
**File:** `hist_avg_score.png`

**Interpretation:**  
- Roughly normal distribution  
- Centered around 75–80  
- Indicates generally strong academic achievements  

---

## 📍 4.2. Boxplot — Average Score by Test Preparation  
**File:** `box_avg_by_prep.png`

**Interpretation:**  
- Students completing test preparation score higher  
- Less score variability → prep course effectiveness  
- Those without prep show wider score dispersion  

---

## 📍 4.3. Bar Chart — Gender vs Average Score  
**File:** `bar_gender_means.png`

**Interpretation:**  
- Minor difference between male/female performance  
- Females slightly outperform males  
- No evidence of gender-based performance gaps  

---

## 📍 4.4. Correlation Matrix  
**File:** `corr_matrix.png`

**Interpretation:**  
- Strong correlation between reading and writing  
- Study hours positively correlated with avg_score  
- Math less correlated with verbal subjects  

---

## 📍 4.5. Scatter Plot — Study Hours vs Average Score  
**File:** `scatter_hours_vs_avg.png`

**Interpretation:**  
- Clear positive trend  
- More study → higher scores  
- Plateau effect after ~15 hours  
- Some outliers (many hours but low average)  

---

# 5. Machine Learning Model  
Algorithm: **RandomForestRegressor**

### 🔢 Performance Metrics  
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| MAE | 1.503 |
| RMSE | 1.885 |
| R² | 0.916 |

### Interpretation  
- The model explains **91.6%** of the variance → excellent  
- Low prediction error (≈ 1.5 points)  
- Most influential variables:  
  - study_hours  
  - reading_score  
  - writing_score  
  - test_preparation  

---

# 6. Conclusion  

This analysis shows:

- Students generally perform well
- Test preparation significantly increases performance
- Gender has little impact on performance
- Study hours have a strong but nonlinear influence
- Machine learning provides accurate score predictions

### 🔧 Possible Extensions  
- Add more ML models (SVR, XGBoost)  
- Perform demographic subgroup analysis  
- Conduct feature importance analysis
